[features]
default = ['wasm-module']

# Includes default parsing support for `*.wat` and `*.wast` files (wasm
# modules). This isn't always needed though if you're parsing just an
# s-expression based format. If you'd like to slim down this dependency to just
# the lexer, parser framework, and token support, this feature can be disabled.
#
# This feature is turned on by default.
